                        <h2>JavaScripts Basics</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for  avariety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
                            flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScriptlives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects
                            these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Variable Declaration JavaScriptvariables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript
                                variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.  var x;</li>
                            <li>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  
                                The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.  var x = 10;</li>
                            <li>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to oeprate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript 
                                primitives: Boolean - true or fase; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - 
                                {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
                            <li>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have 
                                been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements:  if a specified condition is true, do 
                                this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                            <li>Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will 
                                repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</li>
                            <li>Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think o fit as a list of instructions.  As an 
                                example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place 
                                the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
